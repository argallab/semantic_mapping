# Semantic Mapping for Wheelchair Navigation
The goal of this project is to utilize a tablet mounted on a wheelchair's armrest to offer real-time feedback of the environment to the user. This feedback will include semantic labeling which can be shown on the mapped environment either when the user logs a landmark or when a landmark is identified through further inference. For autonomous navigation towards a landmark, the user can initiate a plan by selecting it from the displayed landmarks.

This repository is a work in progress.
